# Package to provide embedded Draw.io diagram editting support in Atom

Create and edit your draw.io diagrams directly from within the Atom editor.

This is an early release - please feel free to contribute and improve this
package.

Note:
Ideally, draw.io (mxfiles) should be able to be rendered when referenced
from Markdown files as images.  Also, support needed to render in Github markdown
and gh-pages/jekyll.
